# JooHyuns Venue Hire System

The system will be able to store information about venues and their bookings. 

The venue hire company will use the system developed to manage their venues and bookings. The system will be used by the venue hire company's staff to:

- View details of all the venues,
- Create new venues,
- View details of all the bookings for a venue,
- Create new bookings for a venue,
- Add catering, music, and floral services to a booking,
- View the invoice for a booking.

Due to the venue hire company's limited budget (it's apparently tough being a venue hire company), we will only design a terminal-driven interface for them. This means that the system will be controlled by a menu system that will be displayed on the terminal. The menu will allow staff members to select from a list of commands. The staff member will be able to select a command by typing its code and any arguments it expects. Some commands require additional options, which are prompted by the system one at a time. The system will then execute the appropriate action. This was Programmed with Java.

To run:
1. Download all files
2. Open the folder directory on the local computer and run this prompt in the command prompt/terminal.

.\mvnw.cmd clean compile exec:java@run
